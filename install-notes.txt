The last two tables use quite large datasets and may take a little while to populate. 
All database setup files are located in the db folder.

Please use this link to access the full set of datasets:

Once the you have the datasets:

1. Run setup.sql or setup-small.sql
2. Run procedure.sql

The database is now ready to be used by our site. Enjoy!
