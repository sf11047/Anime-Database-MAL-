The last two tables use quite large datasets and may take a little while to populate. 
All database setup files are located in the db folder.

Please use this link to access the full set of datasets:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wgK4j1U7HfrxzVHmWJvwOfqSPCnXhd3i?usp=sharing

Once the you have the datasets:

1. Run setup.sql or setup-small.sql
You can do so by running
mysql -h dbase.cs.jhu.edu -u username -D dbname -p < setup.sql
or
mysql -h dbase.cs.jhu.edu -u username -D dbname -p < setup-small.sql

* Note that the file paths must be replaced with the path to the files on your specific machine in both setup.sql and setup-small.sql

2. Run procedure.sql
You can do so by running 
mysql -h dbase.cs.jhu.edu -u username -D dbname -p < procedure.sql

The database is now ready to be used by our site. Enjoy!
